# Team Report

## Project Meeting Agenda

- API Stability (Discuss search features and additional repository improvements so it works 100% for the demo)
- Front-End Integration with the backend

## Last Week's Goals

- As a team, discuss which endpoints we want to have restricted to a user being signed in, and implement JWT token authorization accordingly (est 2 days)
- Implement functionality for viewing application history, in whole and grouped by status (est 2 days)
- Research options for storing user submitted photos, and decide whether we want to proceed with implementation based on findings. (est 2 days)
- Implement endpoints & unit tests for gig listing modification (est 2-3 days)

## Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Implement functionality for viewing application history, in whole and grouped by status (est 2 days)
- Implement endpoints & unit tests for gig listing modification (est 2-3 days)

# Individual Contributions

## Amy

### Last Week's Goals

- Implement the backend functionality to modify a gig listing (est 2 days)
  - This includes updating content, changing the status, deleting, etc.
- Implement backend functionality for influencers to view their application history, pending and active gigs (est 2 days)
- Expand gig listing unit tests to include new gig modification test cases (est 1 day)
- Research storage options for storing user-uploaded photos (est 1 day)

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:

- Aided Roman in debugging configuration issues so that he can build again.
- Aided Matthew in merging main into his feature branches and resolving merge-conflicts, so that other items I had in progress could be completed in time for Wednesday's demo.
- Updated the client-side data module to include the recently added endpoints.
- Implemented front-end forms for gig listing creation and applications, to prepare for the beta demo.
- Investigated storage options for handling user submitted photos.
- Enhanced the JWT token implementation to utilize an HTTP only cookie, which reduces the amount of information that the front-end must provide the server for API calls.
- Implemented the back-end functionality to sign-out, including removal of the HTTP Only cookie on the client-side.
- Updated our README to incorporate feedback from P7 deliverable.
- Began implementing the backend functionality to modify a gig listing.
- Collaborated with the team to develop a comprehensive user guide, and refine our development guide.

#### What went well:

- Despite not being where we wanted to be at the end of Sunday, the team was able to pull together and enhance our demo-able product before Wednesday's lecture.
- Resolved some issues that had been hampering group member's ability to build/develop the project.

#### What I struggled with:

- Getting ready for the demo took more capacity than I had hoped, as the team found ourselves needing some increased attention on the front-end components to enhance our potential beta.
- I was worried that we were going to be ill-prepared for the demo, as the attempts that I made to coordinate times for the team to get together and discuss roles/content did not materialize as intended.

#### Where I am blocked:

- Pressures on my time to assist the group with configurations, version control, and implementing front-end components prevented me from being able to complete some of the backend tasks that I had originally intended to complete.
  - I have begun the implementation for modifying a gig listing, but am not certain if I will be able to complete it before Sunday night.
- My goal of implementing functionality for influencers to view their past applications and pending/accepted gig listings is blocked by the lack of a profile page/UI to integate with.

#### What I learned:

- I discovered the ability to manage a user's JWT token using HTTP only cookies, which simplifies the process of the front-end calling APIs and passing user-specific information.

### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Implement the backend functionality to modify a gig listing (est 2 days)
  - This includes updating content, changing the status, deleting, etc.
  - This has been started, but is included for next week due to concerns that I will not be able to complete it by Sunday night.
- Implement backend functionality for influencers to view their application history, pending and active gigs (est 2 days).
- Develop unit tests for the newly added gig-listing endpoints (est. 1 day)
