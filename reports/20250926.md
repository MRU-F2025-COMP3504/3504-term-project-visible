#### What I learned:
- Using the Expo framework makes setting up a React Native app very easy to do
- Supabase has a significant amount of documentation for various OAuth solutions, and would likely be a valuable resource for our project

## Alexander

#### What went well:
- Group has had both active and productive communication
- We made progress in making some of the major decisions for the project

#### What I struggled with:

#### Where I am blocked:
- See above section

#### What I learned:
- Discussions can be very helpful in attuning to group members skills sets and preferences

### Plans & Goals for Next Week
- Contribute to Architecture & Design discussions
- Produce a low-fidelity prototype for the search/filtering use case
- Conduct preliminary research, including review of previous assignments, on react front-end architecture, convention, and limitations, especially on integration with back-end systems. Aiming to prevent any unexpected problems from creeping up on us.
