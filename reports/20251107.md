# Individual Contributions

## Amy

### Last Week's Goals

- Implement the backend functionality to create and update gig listings (1 day)
- Implement unit tests for the Gig Listing endpoints noted above (1 day)
- Secure a custom domain for the project site (0.5 days)

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:

- Implemented backend functionality for creating and updating gig listings.
- Implemented unit tests for gig listing endpoints.
- Implemented JWT token functionality in backend for user authentication/authorization
- Secured a custom domain for the project.
- Helped Alex debug failing API calls for sign-in and sign-up.
- Implemented backend functionality to apply to a gig listing.

#### What went well:

- I was able to quickly create and test a number of endpoints that will be helpful for our beta demo next week.
- JWT token generation and validation was fairly easy to implement.

#### What I struggled with:

- While I did not struggle to get the sign-in and sign-up API endpoints created, I struggled to get them to work with a mocked-out front end while another team mate was creating the components. Thankfully, this was resolved fairly quickly, once the front-end component became available.

#### Where I am blocked:

- N/A

#### What I learned:

- I learned how to implement JWT tokens for user session management and API protection within .NET.

### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Implement the backend functionality to modify a gig listing (est 2 days)
  - This includes updating content, changing the status, deleting, etc.
- Implement backend functionality for influencers to view their application history, pending and active gigs (est 2 days)
- Expand gig listing unit tests to include new gig modification test cases (est 1 day)
- Research storage options for storing user-uploaded photos (est 1 day)

## Matthew

### Last Week's Goals

- Definitely want to do testing with the influencer API endpoints to confirm creation and retrieval actually work.
- Begin working towards creating business API

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:
- Created and structured the BusinessRepository. Implementation includes retrival of all businesses, by name and profile creation.
- built the BusinessController with API endpoints for those operations mention prior
- Reconfigured Docker setup

#### What went well:
- Docker build configuration was successful with the support of the updated dev guide
- BusinessRepository was not too challenging as I built off of the influencer API

#### What I struggled with:
- N/A

#### Where I am blocked:
- Testing my endpoints, will look into Postman to test my influencer and business APIs

#### What I learned:
- Feeling more confident working with C# (Syntax is becoming easier to read)
- The building of an API flow from have a table built on SQL, Repository and controller
- Working with Github

### Plans & Goals for Next Week
- Learn how to use Postman for APIs
- Test influencer/business API endpoints using Postman
- implement unit testing
- Look into how I can assist with integration
- Work on P7 deliverable

## Roman

### Last Week's Goals

- Figure out what needs to be done for the next p5 deliverable and help with that
- Figure out what front end component needs to be made and complete that

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:

- Worked on a basic Nav component
- Help on P5 sunday once I got home from my Ukranian Dance Perormance
- Worked on the P7 Deliverable over the weekend

#### What went well:

- I am becomming more familiar with putting together local builds and

#### What I struggled with:

- My build broke twice seemingly out of random. both times it broke, it took me half a day to fix. Im still not sure why they broke in the first place
- I lost a lot of time due to being sick Wendsday and Thrusday, and from last weeks Ukranian Dance performance over the weekend.

#### Where I am blocked:

- I need a reliable way that my build will not just randomly break on me. I fixed my build monday, didnt touch a thing, and it breaks on me wendsday!

#### What I learned:

- I have learned mroe github version controlls, and how to create and partially fix builds on my local machine

### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Finish nav bar componenet without my build breaking
- Find a consistent way to keep my builds from breaking
- See if anybody else needs help building, finishing, or testing componenets
