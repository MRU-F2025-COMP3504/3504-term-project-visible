# Team Report

## Project Meeting Agenda

- Main discussion: Sort out what tools we will be using (test-automation and continuous integration) for the backend and for the frontend
  - What testing tool should we use React?
  - Do you have any suggestions for how much of the UI we should aim to try and test?
- Should we set up the continuous integration first, or should we make some unit tests first using a C# framework like xUnit?

## Last Week's Goals

- Deployable live build? - Basic page to showcase front end components
- Implement initial sign up / sign in functionality

## Progress & Issues

- Created baseline React/.NET app with connection to a Postgresql database, using Docker containers
- Started developer guide to facilitate easier onboarding when beginning work on the project

## Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Set up the basic UI interfaces for main pages - Sign in, Search, Profile pages (needs estimate)
- Implement the sign-up/sign-in functionality on the backend (est. 2 days)
- Begin implementation of profile creation functionality (est 2 days)
- Configure “live” environment for the project, including CD to stay up to date with new changes (est. 1-2 days)
- As a team, research CI/CD options for the project, and decide on the service we want to work with (2-3 days)

# Individual Contributions

## Amy

### Last Week's Goals

- Consult with the team to finalize long-term technology strategy for front/back-end development. (1 day)
- Set up the back-end architecture in our Github repository. (1 day)
- Implement the login/authentication functionality, including error handling (2 days)

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:

- After discussion with the team, I created a new ASP.NET/React project for our website
- Configured backend project structure
- Setup Docker images for Database and WebApp
- Created sample page demonstrating the connection between front-end and backend with calls to database for gig information
- Spent some time trying to better understand the Sign in with Google process
- Finalized requirements and structure for user table so that login functionality can be implemented

#### What went well:

- Docker seems to have effectively streamlined the dev environment

#### What I struggled with:

- I ran into a couple of issues trying to wrap my head around the Sign in with Google requirements, so I made less progress with this than I would have liked
- After talking to the team, I think we’ve decided to populate our user table with mock users, and consider returning to third-party auth later in the project if it makes sense

#### Where I am blocked:

- Due to midterms & other commitments, as well as the struggle with Sign in with Google, I may not get login functionality implemented before Monday

#### What I learned:

- I learnt a lot about how to configure separate Docker containers and get them to talk to each other
- Connecting a C# backend to a Postgres database, and how that translates on the front-end React app
- Docker Secrets seem quite powerful for maintaining the security of privileged information

### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Setup production server with continuous deployment off of the main branch (1-2 days)
  - This involves researching options and consulting with the team.
- Complete login/authentication functionality, including error handling. (2 days)
  - This may be started before the week starts, pending progress between now and Monday.

## Alexander

### Last Week's Goals

- Begin developing generic / frequently used front end components - with the goal of preventing any bottlenecking in other team-members' work flows (such as UX design).

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:

- Added MUI & Tailwind packages to the project to implement many generic components that we will need
- Did some code review of back-end prs
- Added a basic sign-in page / form for use in development/testing of sign in features

#### What went well:

- The code review process went well & made sense

#### What I struggled with:

- We have an issue to resolve in managing docker - does not currently run while npm package files are present, potentially because of version mismatch in the docker image

#### Where I am blocked:

- Not currently stuck but if the above issue can’t be resolved I might be

#### What I learned:

- Increased understanding of gh version control work flows and process

### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Basic (functional) views completed for main view -> Sign in page, search pages, profile pages

## Matthew

### Last Week's Goals

- Continue working on the database, add fields. Refine and test with dummy data.

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:

- I updated the postgreSQL database using DBeaver. Within the schema I designed and implemented the required tables (Users, Profiles, Gigs, Applications and Ratings) with a revision on the data types.
- I also established constraints such as CHECK condition, timestamps and “Referential integrity rules” to ensure consistency on data linkage.
- I also utilized DBeaver visualizer to create an ER diagram in which I intend to provide the frontend for reference.
- Did some dummy data testing however minimal

#### What went well:

- The database setup and schema creation process in DBeaver worked smoothly once PostgreSQL was properly configured which surprisingly was not so easy.

#### What I struggled with:

- I had trouble connecting DBeaver to PostgreSQL at first and getting the visible schema to show up. I also ran into issues with foreign key validation.

#### Where I am blocked:

- N/A

#### What I learned:

- I relearnt how to properly set up and manage PostgreSQL database using DBeaver

### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Begin mapping out how I will use C# to connect to PostgreSQL
- Potentially build a small test API like one end point that can read and insert data into the user table

## Roman

### Last Week's Goals

- Complete and finalize website UI

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:

- Complete and finalize the website’s UI using our high fidelity prototype using google slides

#### What went well:

- Google slides was an effective tool for making our high fidelity prototype

#### What I struggled with:

- Figma proved to be challenging working with multiple people, hence why we switched to google slides

#### Where I am blocked:

- n/a

#### What I learned:

- I have learned how to use figma to prototype individual projects

### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Complete as many front end components as possible
- Complete main use case font end pages that will be used to test back end functionality
