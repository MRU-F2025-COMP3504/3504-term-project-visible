### Last Week's Goals

- Implement the backend functionality to modify a gig listing (est 2 days)
  - This includes updating content, changing the status, deleting, etc.
  - This has been started, but is included for next week due to concerns that I will not be able to complete it by Sunday night.
- Implement backend functionality for influencers to view their application history, pending and active gigs (est 2 days).
- Develop unit tests for the newly added gig-listing endpoints (est. 1 day)

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:

- Implemented front-end components for searching influencers and businesses, in addition to gig listings.
- Attempted to facilitate team communication so that we can decide which features we want to prioritize for the final release presentation.

### Last Week's Goals

- Refine current front-end implementations
- Update dev and user guides for incoming reviewers
- Test front end components (most of them are from components libraries however, so tests should be oriented at the behaviour we implement)
