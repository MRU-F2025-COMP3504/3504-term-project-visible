### Last Week's Goals

- Implement the backend functionality to modify a gig listing (est 2 days)
  - This includes updating content, changing the status, deleting, etc.
  - This has been started, but is included for next week due to concerns that I will not be able to complete it by Sunday night.
- Implement backend functionality for influencers to view their application history, pending and active gigs (est 2 days).
- Develop unit tests for the newly added gig-listing endpoints (est. 1 day)

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:

- Implemented front-end components for searching influencers and businesses, in addition to gig listings.
- Attempted to facilitate team communication so that we can decide which features we want to prioritize for the final release presentation.
- Integrated the JWT cookie authentication with the front-end components, and simplified some existing UI flows.

#### What went well:

- Receiving feedback on Monday allowed me to not sink valuable time into backend functionality that may be too risky for the final demo.

#### What I struggled with:

- I did not achieve the goals I had initially planned for this week, after the discussion from Monday's project meeting. Given the length of time remaining, my goals were a bit too ambitious for the project in general, and my priorities needed to shift.
- I've found it challenging to determine where my efforts are best directed, because I've received minimal input from the team on the components that we want to prioritize for the final presentation.

#### Where I am blocked:

- See above. I want to make meaningful progress, but do not want to make unilateral decisions for the team.

#### What I learned:

-

### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- With the team, determine which pieces of feedback we want to address for the final presentation.
- Implement fixes where I am best fit to do so.
- Test the release candidate build, and begin preparing for the final presentation.

### Last Week's Goals

- Refine current front-end implementations
- Update dev and user guides for incoming reviewers
- Test front end components (most of them are from components libraries however, so tests should be oriented at the behaviour we implement)

### Last Week's Goals

- Improve the structure of the business and influencer repository queries
- Add unit tests for the business and influencer APIs
- Improve documentation of my code

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:
- Reviewed the current backend structure, to figure out what added features we could use for our final presentation.
- Started working toards unit testing the business repository


#### What went well:
- Updating and refining the documentation (User guide) helped me solidify my understanding of the architecture.

#### What I struggled with:
- Didn’t get as far on query restructuring as intended due to other urgent priorities
#### Where I am blocked:
N/A
#### What I learned:
The gaps in my testing knowledge, however that is primarily due to time.
### Plans & Goals for Next Week
- Restructure the query logic inside the repositories
- Support the front end to enable a seamless final presentation
- Implement unit tests for the Business and Influencer API
