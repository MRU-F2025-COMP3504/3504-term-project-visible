# Team Report

## Project Meeting Agenda

- Review progress and issues from the last week.
- Advice on workflow / process for consecutive PRs before code reviews
- What features would the client like to see prioritized next? Is there anything in our backlog’s ordering that doesn’t make sense?

## Last Week's Goals

- Set up the basic UI interfaces for main pages - Sign in, Search, Profile pages (needs estimate)
- Implement the sign-up/sign-in functionality on the backend (est. 2 days)
- Begin implementation of profile creation functionality (est 2 days)
- Configure “live” environment for the project, including CD to stay up to date with new changes (est. 1-2 days)
- As a team, research CI/CD options for the project, and decide on the service we want to work with (2-3 days)

# Individual Contributions

## Amy

### Last Week's Goals

- Setup production/”live” server with continuous deployment off of the main branch (1-2 days)
  - This involves researching options and consulting with the team.
- Complete login/authentication functionality, including error handling. (2 days)
  - This may be started before the week starts, pending progress between now and Monday.
- Implement profile creation endpoints (est. 2 days)

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:

- Continued migration of feature/task/knowledge acquisition work items into GitHub project for ease of tracking.
- Implemented backend APIs for email/password sign-in and sign-up.
- Researched unit testing frameworks for C# and implemented a couple of tests for the visible.Services project.
- Researched CI options to try and aid in P6 completion.
- Investigated how to configure a self-hosted solution for the live version of our app.

#### What went well:

- I was able to test and validate the sign-in and sign-up API endpoints using Postman, with mock data from the user table.
- I was able to get unit testing incorporated into part of the backend infrastructure.

#### What I struggled with:

- When trying to implement a unit test for a database query, I initially had trouble trying to mock out the connection and other required components/classes. I ended up spending some time researching what was required to make it possible to unit test this type of functionality without having a database available.
- When trying to ensure that everyone had appropriate tasks on Wednesday, Matthew mentioned that he had been hoping to try implementing this functionality for influencer profiles. Because of the remaining work on P6, I let him take this on to start, so that I could dedicate more time to CI research and eventual implementation.

#### Where I am blocked:

- At times, it feels like there is a feeling of confusion within the team, regarding what tasks should be tackled next. Additionally, I’ve found myself asking team members to clarify what their action items are, as it feels like there may be some amount of duplicated effort, which could lead to missed opportunities for feature implementation. I’ve been trying to help course correct when I’ve noticed this and brought it up within the team but I’m wondering if there’s a way I could be more effective in supporting the overall goals and direction?

#### What I learned:

- Unit testing for database functionality is not necessarily the most straightforward at first, but there are ways to overcome obstacles using mocking tools.
- Continuous Integration services can be overwhelming when trying to understand what is required for the setup. Thankfully, I have some prior experience writing yaml files, which may aid in the configuration process.

### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Implement the backend functionality to create and update gig listings (1 day)
- Implement unit tests for the Gig Listing endpoints noted above (1 day)
- Secure a custom domain for the project site (0.5 days)

## Alexander

### Last Week's Goals

- Basic (functional) views completed for main view -> Sign in page, search pages, profile pages

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:

- Did not accomplish my goals for this week as of Friday - got some other foundational stuff done
- Implemented a data & interface module to compartmentalize data handling functions & typescript interfaces
- Created a development component to easily contain all testing code
- Modified some of the typescript configurations to support the development process - can be edited closer to “release” to reinstate certain enforcement / code cleanup
- Did some code review
- Did some knowledge acquisition / research on docker & typescript/react

#### What went well:

- Configured typescript to better support the development process
- Was able to cleanup the main front app file using the modules I made

#### What I struggled with:

- TypeScript enforcement is slightly confusing considering some of the things that react abstracts away. For example, an event object shifting from something like (e) to (e: MouseEvent<HTMLButtonEvent>). It took some time what requirements typescript was enforcing and how that interacted with react, and how to modify the TS configuration to smooth the development process.

#### Where I am blocked:

- The current docker configuration does not support ‘hot-reloading’ the front end components. This is causing 30-60s lead times to see changes while tinkering with front end components (as the containers need to be fully rebuilt for any change).
- I was not able to figure out how to modify our docker configuration to solve this problem, and I wasted a significant amount of time trying to figure it out.
- I’m not sure if the issue lies within how our ASP.net app is configured / structured or if docker can solve the problem itself.

#### What I learned:

- More familiar with typescript’s enforcement and configuration now, especially in the context of react
- While I didn’t solve the problem I have a better understanding of how docker works and is set up and configured.

### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Implement at least the forms required to test back-end functionality & work on the views that will contain them
- Consider methodology for CI/CD and testing of front-end components, and draft a plan

## Matthew

### Last Week's Goals

- Begin mapping out how I will use C# to connect to PostgreSQL
- Potentially build a small test API like one end point that can read and insert data into the user table

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:

- Created the influencer API (Model, interface,repository and controller)
- Connected the API to PostgreSQL database using npgsql (Used Amy’s work as reference)
- InfluencerRepository has SQL logic to query the database
- Prepared dummy data in the user table for testing the influencer creation however I will need to figure out how to perform tests.
- Creation of a feature branch (Still working on my understanding of collaborative work)

#### What went well:

- Database connection to PostgreSQL
- Improved understanding of the creation of influencer API (Creating API)
- Successful configuration of environment

#### What I struggled with:

- Understanding how to create an API
- Determining the correct branch workflow as I was working under the wrong one so I ended up creating a new one.

#### Where I am blocked:

- Testing if my influencer API works, specifically the creation of an influencer profile and search functionality (Search all or by email).

#### What I learned:

- How to connect C# to PstgreSQL using npgsql
- Structure a repository with models,interfaces and controllers
- Basic but registering services in program.cs
- Improved understanding in branch management to ensure the features are kept separated in Git

### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Definitely want to do testing with the influencer API endpoints to confirm creation and retrieval actually work.
- Begin working towards creating business API

## Roman

### Last Week's Goals

- Complete as many front end components as possible
- Complete main use case font end pages that will be used to test back end functionality

### Progress & Issues

- Issue, I had WAY less time than I expected to have this week due to 2 Ukrainian Dance performances on the 25th and 1st.

#### What I did:

- Set up development environment on my computer
- Completed a javascript and Github review for front end work

#### What went well:

- The review went well. Even though we are going to be working in a completely new environment, I somewhat understand what things do, which is better than last week

#### What I struggled with:

- I didn't have as much time as I thought I would have for working on main features
- I forgot that I needed to get my coding environment ready BEFORE working in it. oops!

#### Where I am blocked:

- I'm not sure what task I should prioritise to work on right now, all seem like they need to be done at a similar

#### What I learned:

- Extra curricular takes so much more time out of your schedule than expected, even when you planned for it

### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Figure out what needs to be done for the next p5 deliverable and help with that
- Figure out what front end component needs to be made and complete that
