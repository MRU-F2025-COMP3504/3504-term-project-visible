# Team Report

## Project Meeting Agenda

## Last Week's Goals
- Set up the basic UI interfaces for main pages - Sign in, Search, Profile pages (needs estimate)
- Implement the sign-up/sign-in functionality on the backend (est. 2 days)
- Begin implementation of profile creation functionality (est 2 days)
- Configure “live” environment for the project, including CD to stay up to date with new changes (est. 1-2 days)
- As a team, research CI/CD options for the project, and decide on the service we want to work with (2-3 days)

## Progress & Issues


## Plans & Goals for Next Week


# Individual Contributions

## Amy
### Last Week's Goals
- Setup production/”live” server with continuous deployment off of the main branch (1-2 days)
  - This involves researching options and consulting with the team.
- Complete login/authentication functionality, including error handling. (2 days)
  - This may be started before the week starts, pending progress between now and Monday.
- Implement profile creation endpoints (est. 2 days)

## Alexander
### Last Week's Goals
- Basic (functional) views completed for main view -> Sign in page, search pages, profile pages

### Progress & Issues
#### What I did:
- Did not accomplish my goals for this week as of Friday - got some other foundational stuff done
- Implemented a data & interface module to compartmentalize data handling functions & typescript interfaces
- Created a development component to easily contain all testing code
- Modified some of the typescript configurations to support the development process - can be edited closer to “release” to reinstate certain enforcement / code cleanup
- Did some code review
- Did some knowledge acquisition / research on docker & typescript/react

#### What went well:
- Configured typescript to better support the development process
- Was able to cleanup the main front app file using the modules I made

#### What I struggled with:
- TypeScript enforcement is slightly confusing considering some of the things that react abstracts away. For example, an event object shifting from something like (e) to (e: MouseEvent<HTMLButtonEvent>). It took some time what requirements typescript was enforcing and how that interacted with react, and how to modify the TS configuration to smooth the development process.

#### Where I am blocked:
- The current docker configuration does not support ‘hot-reloading’ the front end components. This is causing 30-60s lead times to see changes while tinkering with front end components (as the containers need to be fully rebuilt for any change).
- I was not able to figure out how to modify our docker configuration to solve this problem, and I wasted a significant amount of time trying to figure it out.
- I’m not sure if the issue lies within how our ASP.net app is configured / structured or if docker can solve the problem itself.

#### What I learned:
- More familiar with typescript’s enforcement and configuration now, especially in the context of react
- While I didn’t solve the problem I have a better understanding of how docker works and is set up and configured.

### Plans & Goals for Next Week
- Implement at least the forms required to test back-end functionality & work on the views that will contain them
- Consider methodology for CI/CD and testing of front-end components, and draft a plan

## Matthew
### Last Week's Goals
- Begin mapping out how I will use C# to connect to PostgreSQL
- Potentially build a small test API like one end point that can read and insert data into the user table

### Progress & Issues
#### What I did:
- Created the influencer API (Model, interface,repository and controller)
- Connected the API to PostgreSQL database using npgsql (Used Amy’s work as reference)
- InfluencerRepository has SQL logic to query the database
- Prepared dummy data in the user table for testing the influencer creation however I will need to figure out how to perform tests.
- Creation of a feature branch (Still working on my understanding of collaborative work)

#### What went well:
- Database connection to PostgreSQL
- Improved understanding of the creation of influencer API (Creating API)
- Successful configuration of environment

#### What I struggled with:
- Understanding how to create an API
- Determining the correct branch workflow as I was working under the wrong one so I ended up creating a new one.

#### Where I am blocked:
- Testing if my influencer API works, specifically the creation of an influencer profile and search functionality (Search all or by email).

#### What I learned:
- How to connect C# to PstgreSQL using npgsql
- Structure a repository with models,interfaces and controllers
- Basic but registering services in program.cs
- Improved understanding in branch management to ensure the features are kept separated in Git

### Plans & Goals for Next Week
- Definitely want to do testing with the influencer API endpoints to confirm creation and retrieval actually work.
- Begin working towards creating business API

## Roman
### Last Week's Goals
- Complete as many front end components as possible
- Complete main use case font end pages that will be used to test back end functionality

### Progress & Issues
- Issue, I had WAY less time than I expected to have this week due to 2 Ukrainian Dance performances on the 25th and 1st.

#### What I did:
- Set up development environment on my computer
- Completed a javascript and Github review for front end work

#### What went well:
- The review went well. Even though we are going to be working in a completely new environment, I somewhat understand what things do, which is better than last week

#### What I struggled with:
- I didn't have as much time as I thought I would have for working on main features
- I forgot that I needed to get my coding environment ready BEFORE working in it. oops!

#### Where I am blocked:
- I'm not sure what task I should prioritise to work on right now, all seem like they need to be done at a similar 

#### What I learned:
- Extra curricular takes so much more time out of your schedule than expected, even when you planned for it

### Plans & Goals for Next Week
- Figure out what needs to be done for the next p5 deliverable and help with that
- Figure out what front end component needs to be made and complete that
