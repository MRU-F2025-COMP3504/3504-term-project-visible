# Team Report
## P3 Deliverable Issues Addressed
- Revised use cases.

## Project Meeting Agenda
- Review low-fidelity prototype submissions with Apoorve
- Track potential feature suggestions / refinements based on low fidelity prototypes
- Raise any p5 questions with Apoorve, time permitting

## Last Week's Goals
- Complete and submit P3: Requirements and Planning document
- Organize a structure for how we will approach weekly status updates
- Begin understanding/assigning team roles based on strengths and preferences

## Progress & Issues
- Settled on different tools
- We have an increased understanding of team-member roles and responsibilities.
- We have a better understanding of the architectural approach we are planning to implement.
- Lacking some understanding of the roles of specific software components, which needs refinement. (Supabase, the NodeJs server)

## Plans & Goals for Next Week
- As a team, discuss/deliberate on preferred development tools, and configure each team member’s development environment. (2–3 days)
- Create a high-fidelity prototype for the Influencer applying to a gig posting use case. (est. 4 days)
- Time required may be lower depending on the medium chosen.
- Prepare the repository and other tools for active development.
- Discuss work flow plans (from the perspective of merge conflicts, etc.)

# Individual Contributions

## Amy
### Last Week's Goals
- Create a low-fidelity prototype for the use case where an influencer applies to an open gig (est. 2 days)
- Contribute to the Architecture & Design discussion & deliverable (est. 3 days)
  - Help the team effectively divide into tasks, so that everyone knows their responsibilities for the completed document
  - Complete the aspects I am responsible for (est. 2  days - already included in the total estimate of 3)
- Research potential architecture solutions to help guide discussions and decisions (est. 1-2 days)

### Progress & Issues
#### What I did:
- Created a Next.js app with Supabase integration to serve as the skeleton for our project.
- Completed the first 6 Next.js tutorials to re-acquaint myself with the structure of Next apps.
- Created a Google Cloud project to allow for Sign in with Google integration.
- Created a low-fidelity prototype for the use case where an influencer applies to an open gig.
- Identified frameworks that can be used for unit-testing and end-to-end testing a Next.js app.
- Contributed to P4 discussions/document.

#### What went well:
- The team seems to be communicating reasonably well.

#### What I struggled with:
- I ran into a minor challenge creating the app with Supabase, due to unclear documentation. 
- I’ve noticed that having the repository private limits some of the features/functionality within GitHub that we are able to leverage. Does the repository need to be private? 

#### Where I am blocked:
- Right now, I’m struggling to try and come up with additional features and stretch goals to provide more flexibility with the work that we can complete in the project.

#### What I learned:
- The process for setting up Sign in with Google is quite easy.
- Supabase documentation is generally pretty good, but I ran into conflicting information which caused a slight roadblock (already overcome).
- Playwright seems like a neat tool to leverage for automated testing.

### Plans & Goals for Next Week
- Complete the Next.js Database Setup, Data Fetching, Error Handling and Authentication tutorials. (2 days)
- Contribute to the P5 deliverable discussions/efforts. (2 days)

## Alexander
### Last Week's Goals
- Contribute to Architecture & Design discussions
- Produce a low-fidelity prototype for the search/filtering use case
- Conduct preliminary research, including review of previous assignments, on react front-end architecture, convention, and limitations, especially on integration with back-end systems. Aiming to prevent any unexpected problems from creeping up on us.

### Progress & Issues
#### What I did:
- Made a low-fidelity prototype for the “applying to a gig” use-case
- Reviewed previous assignments & build process for software tools relevant to the project
- Contributed to P4 discussions
- Added NodeJS coding guidelines to the living document

#### What went well:
- Team has maintained good communication and open discussions

#### What I struggled with:
- Other course work demands my time, contributing to less time being spent on this project than I may be prefer

#### Where I am blocked:
-

#### What I learned:
- Prototyping can be a great way of testing UI design, but also clarifying features details like what’s important or to generate new feature ideas

### Plans & Goals for Next Week
- Ensure the repository is prepped for front-end development
- Contribute to product description & high-fidelity prototype production

## Matthew
### Last Week's Goals
- Work on a living document that has the components I will be working on.
- Familiarize myself with required frameworks

### Progress & Issues
#### What I did:
- Reviewed super-base for it database services and possibly authentication
- Began mapping out data I will need

#### What went well:
- Supabase documentation/youtube tutorials provided insight (Basics)
- Team communication/working together is efficient

#### What I struggled with:
- I am still working on my understanding of how e will connect the front end with a “Node (Server)” with next.js

#### Where I am blocked:
- If and How we are using superbase

#### What I learned:
- What I have learnt, is we will be using a react framework called next.js (Still need to learn)
  - This will provide us with buttons, routing and connects good with superbase
- Superbase if used can provide boiler plate code (with support of their SDK)  for us to accomplish many features we want to accomplish on visible such as fetch data from our database and upload data (Possibly chat app)

### Plans & Goals for Next Week
- Create and work on initial tables in superbase (If picked)
- Work on defining key fields (With open discussion)
- Work on building a documentation during the process

## Roman
### Last Week's Goals
- Learn more about advance Github controls

### Progress & Issues
#### What I did:
- Attend a Figma UI/UX workshop in preparation for next week's rapid prototyping 
- Learn a little bit more about Github controls

#### What went well:
- The basics of figma make sense, but it seems easier for me to do a mock up in powerpoint instead

#### What I struggled with:
- I have had an immense amount of homework due in addition to having the MRU Hackathon coming up, and I have had trouble finding time to fully learn both figma and github 

#### Where I am blocked:
- 

#### What I learned:
- I started to learn how figma works, which can be used as a prototyping rule
- I learned a bit of github, but not enough where I would feel fully confident in not breaking something

### Plans & Goals for Next Week
- Become familiar and comfortable in Github 
- Become proficient in figma
- Create a prototype for our potential UI for our website
