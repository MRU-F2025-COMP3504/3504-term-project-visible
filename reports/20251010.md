# Team Report

## Project Meeting Agenda
- Review team member goals for Reading Week, and align expectations accordingly.
- Assign initial tasks and outline communication plan in case issues arise.

## Last Week's Goals
- As a team, discuss/deliberate on preferred development tools, and configure each team member’s development environment. (2–3 days)
- Create a high-fidelity prototype for the Influencer applying to a gig posting use case. (est. 4 days)
- Time required may be lower depending on the medium chosen.
- Prepare the repository and other tools for active development.
- Discuss work flow plans (from the perspective of merge conflicts, etc.)

## Progress & Issues
- Generated ideas for features & stretch goals, and populated the GitHub project with associated issues.
- Completed the high fidelity prototype for the Influencer applying to a gig posting use case.
- The team has discussed and refined the shared vision for the project’s minimum viable product, to better understand and align ourselves with the project’s goals.

## Plans & Goals for Next Week
- Deployable live build? - Basic page to showcase front end components
- Implement initial sign up / sign in functionality.

# Individual Contributions

## Amy
### Last Week's Goals
- Complete the Next.js Database Setup, Data Fetching, Error Handling and Authentication tutorials. (2 days)
- Contribute to the P5 deliverable discussions/efforts. (2 days)

### Progress & Issues
#### What I did:
- Brainstormed task/feature items for the project backlog as part of the P5 deliverable.
- Started working with Figma to prepare for potential prototyping tasks.
- Worked through Next.js tutorials outlined above.
- Consulted with team members on preferred development tools and worked to get environments set up on each member’s system.
- Added labels/tags to our GitHub project settings to simplify estimation, complexity, etc.
- Created issue templates in the project repository for standardized formatting.

#### What went well:
- I was able to set up our GitHub project issues so that any new issue will automatically be added to the backlog, unless the creator specifies a different status. 

#### What I struggled with:
- N/A

#### Where I am blocked:
- Questioning whether Next.js is the right technology to use for our backend. Will be talking to the team over the weekend to confirm pros/cons of alternatives and solidify plans.

#### What I learned:
- GitHub’s issue templating feature seems like a useful utility to ensure consistency across our created issues.
- Using Supabase for authentication/DB client requires careful consideration of policies to ensure proper data protections against unauthorized access.

### Plans & Goals for Next Week
- Consult with the team to finalize long-term technology strategy for front/back-end development. (1 day)
- Set up the back-end architecture in our Github repository. (1 day)
- Implement the login/authentication functionality, including error handling. (2 days)

## Alexander
### Last Week's Goals
- Ensure the repository is prepped for front-end development
- Contribute to product description & high-fidelity prototype production

### Progress & Issues
#### What I did:
- Not as much as I might’ve liked - heavier focus on other course obligations this week
- Contributed to discussions on the refinement of the project’s features & feature generation
- Setup personal development environment on development PC

#### What went well:
- Did not run into issues configuring my own machine
- Group continues to maintain productive and cordial communication

#### What I struggled with:
- Striving to improve my own understanding of how to estimate and reconcile possible project features within a reasonable and scope

#### Where I am blocked:

#### What I learned:
- Improved knowledge on GitHub workflows, including different branching mechanics
- GitHub task integrations & project management tools

### Plans & Goals for Next Week
- Begin developing generic / frequently used front end components - with the goal of preventing any bottlenecking in other team-members' work flows (such as UX design).

## Matthew
### Last Week's Goals
- Create and work on initial tables in superbase (If picked)
- Work on defining key fields (With open discussion)
