# Team Report

## Project Meeting Agenda

- Review team member goals for Reading Week, and align expectations accordingly.
- Assign initial tasks and outline communication plan in case issues arise.

## Last Week's Goals

- As a team, discuss/deliberate on preferred development tools, and configure each team member’s development environment. (2–3 days)
- Create a high-fidelity prototype for the Influencer applying to a gig posting use case. (est. 4 days)
- Time required may be lower depending on the medium chosen.
- Prepare the repository and other tools for active development.
- Discuss work flow plans (from the perspective of merge conflicts, etc.)

## Progress & Issues

- Generated ideas for features & stretch goals, and populated the GitHub project with associated issues.
- Completed the high fidelity prototype for the Influencer applying to a gig posting use case.
- The team has discussed and refined the shared vision for the project’s minimum viable product, to better understand and align ourselves with the project’s goals.

## Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Deployable live build? - Basic page to showcase front end components
- Implement initial sign up / sign in functionality.

# Individual Contributions

## Amy

### Last Week's Goals

- Complete the Next.js Database Setup, Data Fetching, Error Handling and Authentication tutorials. (2 days)
- Contribute to the P5 deliverable discussions/efforts. (2 days)

### Progress & Issues

#### What I did:

- Brainstormed task/feature items for the project backlog as part of the P5 deliverable.
- Started working with Figma to prepare for potential prototyping tasks.
- Worked through Next.js tutorials outlined above.
- Consulted with team members on preferred development tools and worked to get environments set up on each member’s system.
- Added labels/tags to our GitHub project settings to simplify estimation, complexity, etc.
- Created issue templates in the project repository for standardized formatting.

#### What went well:

- I was able to set up our GitHub project issues so that any new issue will automatically be added to the backlog, unless the creator specifies a different status.

#### What I struggled with:

- N/A

#### Where I am blocked:

- Questioning whether Next.js is the right technology to use for our backend. Will be talking to the team over the weekend to confirm pros/cons of alternatives and solidify plans.

#### What I learned:

- GitHub’s issue templating feature seems like a useful utility to ensure consistency across our created issues.
- Using Supabase for authentication/DB client requires careful consideration of policies to ensure proper data protections against unauthorized access.

### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Consult with the team to finalize long-term technology strategy for front/back-end development. (1 day)
- Set up the back-end architecture in our Github repository. (1 day)
- Implement the login/authentication functionality, including error handling. (2 days)

#### What I learned:

- Improved knowledge on GitHub workflows, including different branching mechanics
- GitHub task integrations & project management tools

### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Begin developing generic / frequently used front end components - with the goal of preventing any bottlenecking in other team-members' work flows (such as UX design).
