# Individual Contributions

## Amy
### Last Week's Goals
- Complete the Next.js Database Setup, Data Fetching, Error Handling and Authentication tutorials. (2 days)
- Contribute to the P5 deliverable discussions/efforts. (2 days)

### Progress & Issues
#### What I did:
- Brainstormed task/feature items for the project backlog as part of the P5 deliverable.
- Started working with Figma to prepare for potential prototyping tasks.
- Worked through Next.js tutorials outlined above.
- Consulted with team members on preferred development tools and worked to get environments set up on each member’s system.
- Added labels/tags to our GitHub project settings to simplify estimation, complexity, etc.
- Created issue templates in the project repository for standardized formatting.

#### What went well:
- I was able to set up our GitHub project issues so that any new issue will automatically be added to the backlog, unless the creator specifies a different status. 

#### What I struggled with:
- N/A

#### Where I am blocked:
- Questioning whether Next.js is the right technology to use for our backend. Will be talking to the team over the weekend to confirm pros/cons of alternatives and solidify plans.

#### What I learned:
- GitHub’s issue templating feature seems like a useful utility to ensure consistency across our created issues.
- Using Supabase for authentication/DB client requires careful consideration of policies to ensure proper data protections against unauthorized access.

### Plans & Goals for Next Week
- Consult with the team to finalize long-term technology strategy for front/back-end development. (1 day)
- Set up the back-end architecture in our Github repository. (1 day)
- Implement the login/authentication functionality, including error handling. (2 days)
